Running this tool:
1. Run DFCXPhraseGeneratorApplication.java
2. Hit http://localhost:8080/intentgenerator.html
3. Give a Intent, for which you need Training Phrases
4. You will see 10 training phrases on the screen
5. Now, these phrases can be uploaded to Dialogflow CX virtual agent and train the model.

Please note, in this example we have only shown to upload the training phrase for a particular
agent which is configured in the code. This can be further extended and externalize the agent
name to be picked dynamically or list down all the agents and upload it to the selected one.
